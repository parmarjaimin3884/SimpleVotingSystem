# Simple Voting System
# Description :
--> A simple voting system where users can vote for different political parties (CON, BJP, ADP) or for NOTA (None Of The Above). The program then counts the votes and determines the winner, or if there is a tie.

# Features :
Voters can vote for one of the following options:
1) CON (Congress)
2) BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party)
3) ADP (Aam Aadmi Party)
4) NOTA (None Of The Above)

--> The program counts votes for each option.

--> The result is displayed with the number of votes for each option.

--> If there is a tie between any two or more options, it will show a message indicating the tie.

--> The winner (if there’s no tie) is displayed with the number of votes by which they won.

# How It Works :
1) Input Voting Options: Users are asked to vote for one of the available parties or NOTA.
2) Vote Counting: The program then counts the votes for each option.
3) Sorting: The votes are sorted in descending order to determine the winner.
4) Tie Check: If there’s a tie, it outputs a message; otherwise, it displays the winner and their lead.
